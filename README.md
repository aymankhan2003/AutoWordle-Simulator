# Wordle Simulation in Python
This Python algorithm simulates a Wordle-like game, demonstrating how the game guesses words and identifies the correct answer. The Words.txt file contains a comprehensive list of possible words. The code reads this file, randomly selects one word as the answer, and then plays out up to 5 guesses, mimicking the real game's mechanics.

The simulation provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it is correct or incorrect and the conditions leading to the outcome. It also showcases the logic behind determining a win or a loss based on the game's rules.
