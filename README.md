# AutoWordle-Simulator
An algorithm in Python that shows how a game like Wordle simulates it's guesses and inputs the right answer. 
The Word.txt file includes every single word possible in this world and we let the code read the file, 
and then randomly choose one word and plays out 5 guesses in similarity with the real game. It shows if a word is incorrect and the circumstances 
behind it, and also the conditions on how it wins.
